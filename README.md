# This Project is for COSC 2030, a project requiring the use of only arrays and linked lists to take information from a user and store
# a handful of different things, max, min, sum, count. 

# This project was completed without the use of linked lists, using arrays and logic statements all needed values were stored in a handful of arrays.

# There are a few known bugs regarding the processing of handling (bad) user input, however processing user input for correctness was not a focus of this project nor was it scored on the rubric.
